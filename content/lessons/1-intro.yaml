        Miorița is a sheep that can be programmed to move in her sheepfold.

        To program her, you simply write instructions.

        In this page, we will learn some of the things she can do.

    // The following line makes Miorița turn to her right (clockwise, like the hands of old clocks)
    turnRight()


    // The following line makes Miorița move forward, in the direction she is facing.
    move()

    // Note: Miorița cannot move outside the sheepfold, or cross any of the walls.

    /*
        Challenge
        =========
        Using the two commands we learned,
        have Miorița go to the grass zone, beyond the wall.

    // BTW, these green lines of text are called "comments"
    // They allow programmers to write anything they want without it being executed
    // They're great for describing what we did in the code,
    // for programmers who might look at the code again.

    // Every programming language has comments.
    // In the one we are using to control Miorița, there are two types of comments
    //  1. Line comments, where everything after the first // is ignored on the same line
    //  2. Block comments, where everything after /* and before */ is ignored, even if it spans over multiple lines.
